# Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales and profitability analysis for a global superstore. Using data from thousands of international orders, this interactive dashboard provides key insights into sales trends, product performance, market distribution, and the impact of returns and discounts. The primary goal is to identify key business drivers, pinpoint areas of unprofitability, and provide actionable data to inform strategic decisions.

This repository includes the raw data, the final dashboard design, and custom theme files for easy replication and further analysis in BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## üìä Data Sources

The analysis is based on three primary CSV files:

* `Orders.csv`: Contains detailed records of each customer order, including order dates, product information, sales figures, profit, and customer details.
* `Returns.csv`: Contains a list of all returned orders and the corresponding market.
* `People.csv`: Maps regional managers to their respective regions.

## üöÄ Dashboard Overview

The final dashboard is split into two main pages for a clear, story-driven analysis:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the business's health, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and global sales trends.
2.  **Profitability Deep Dive:** A detailed analysis page designed to uncover the root causes of profitability issues, focusing on product categories, discounts, and returns.

## üîé Visualizations and Insights

### Page 1: Executive Summary

* **Monthly Sales & Profit Trend:** A line chart that tracks performance over time, helping to identify seasonal trends and the overall growth trajectory.
* **Sales by Global Market (Map):** A world map that visualizes the geographic distribution of sales, highlighting key international markets.

### Page 2: Profitability Deep Dive

* **Profit by Sub-Category:** A horizontal bar chart that clearly identifies the most and least profitable product categories. Unprofitable categories are highlighted in a different color for immediate attention.
* **Returns by Sub-Category:** Complements the profit chart by showing which products are most frequently returned, helping to diagnose if losses are due to quality issues or pricing strategy.
* **Profit vs. Discount (Scatter Plot):** A powerful scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between discounts and profitability for each sub-category, answering the question: "At what point do discounts make our products unprofitable?"
