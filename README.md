# Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive sales and profitability analysis for a global superstore. Using data from thousands of international orders, this interactive dashboard provides key insights into sales trends, product performance, market distribution, and the impact of returns and discounts. The primary goal is to identify key business drivers, pinpoint areas of unprofitability, and provide actionable data to inform strategic decisions.

This repository includes the raw data, the final dashboard design, and custom theme files for easy replication and further analysis in BI tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## üìä Data Sources

The analysis is based on three primary CSV files:

* `Orders.csv`: Contains detailed records of each customer order, including order dates, product information, sales figures, profit, and customer details.
* `Returns.csv`: Contains a list of all returned orders and the corresponding market.
* `People.csv`: Maps regional managers to their respective regions.

The final dashboard is split into two main pages for a clear, story-driven analysis:

1.  **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the business's health, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and global sales trends.
2.  **Profitability Deep Dive:** A detailed analysis page designed to uncover the root causes of profitability issues, focusing on product categories, discounts, and returns.
